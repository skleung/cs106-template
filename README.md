CS 106 Section Website Template
---------------------------

This is a template for CS106 Section leaders to host a static site related to the CS106 courses. It features a simple and easily customized framework for section leaders to host and post links for their sectionees.

The current template and example site both use the Readable theme from bootswatch, but any css file can be used to modify the styles. Just replace the bootstrap.min.css file with a custom css file of your own, or redefine styles already defined in the file.
